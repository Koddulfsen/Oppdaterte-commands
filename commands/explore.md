DO NOT USE ULTRATHINK AND SEQUENTIAL THINK WHEN INITIATING THIS COMMAND. YOU CAN USE IT LATER; BUT FOLLOW IT STRICTLY UPON START.

# Project Exploration - Discovering the Essence

## Goal
Create a high-level overview document that captures the core of the project. This exploration stays general and broad - it's preparing the foundation that `/aspects` will use to break down into detailed planning areas.

This exploratory process will recognize when the core is in place, so that we can move on to /aspects.

## Important
- Stay at a general, overview level - don't drill into details
- Capture the general overview - all MAJOR parts that need to exist
- This document is specifically for `/aspects` to use as input
- Think breadth, not depth
- Try to stay clear of too many examples of how to integrate the different functionalities we uncover, that planning process is for other commands to discover. This is just for the general overview.
- Only ideas that have been discussed will be added to the document. Please don't add to the document before something is discussed with the user.
- Recognize when the core idea is in place, so we can move on to /aspects to further break down the core concept.

## The Process

1. **Setup**
   - Check `/Projects/` for existing similar projects
   - Create new project folder: `/Projects/[project-name]/.wiz/exploration/`
   - Create `/Projects/[project-name]/.wiz/status.md`
      - Status.md will be very brief, containing 3 sections; short project summary, current step, and history.
   - Start `exploration-initial.md` with just the topic

2. **Discovery Through Dialogue**
   - Have a conversation to uncover the project's essence
   - Update the document after each exchange with new discoveries
   - Let the structure emerge naturally from what we find

3. **Key Questions to Explore**
   - What problem does this solve? Who feels this pain?
   - What would success look like? What transformation happens?
   - What are all the parts that need to exist?
   - What makes this unique?
   - What would a user see, feel, experience?
   - What constraints or challenges exist?
   - What aspects would `/aspects` need to plan?

4. **Living Document**
   - Start minimal - just the topic
   - Add discoveries as they emerge
   - No rigid structure - let it grow organically
   - Goal: Complete understanding of all project dimensions

## Remember
- This is ideation, not implementation
- Focus on the "what" and "why", not the "how"
- Stay general - save detailed exploration for `/aspects`
- Keep the conversation flowing with questions
- The document evolves with each exchange
- Output will be used by `/aspects` to create detailed planning
- You will add nothing to the document that has not been discussed.
